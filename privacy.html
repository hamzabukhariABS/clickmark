            <strong>COOKIES</strong><br />What Are Cookies?<br />As is common

            cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to your computer,
            to improve your experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page describes what information they gather, how we use it, and
            why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how
            you can prevent these cookies from being stored however this may
            downgrade or ‘break’ certain elements of the site’s functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>HOW WE USE COOKIES<br /></strong>We use cookies for a
            variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately, in most cases,
            there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without
            completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this
            site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not
            sure whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a
            service that you use.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>DISABLING COOKIES<br /></strong>You can prevent the setting
            of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your
            browser help to know how to do it).
          </p>
          <p>
            Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of
            this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will
            usually result in also disabling certain functionality and features

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>THE COOKIES WE SET<br /></strong>If you create an account
            with us then we will use cookies for the management of the signup
            process and general administration. These cookies will usually be
            deleted when you log out; however, in some cases, they may remain
            afterward to remember your site preferences when logged out.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use cookies when you are logged in so that we can remember this
            fact.
          </p>
          <p>
            This prevents you from having to log in every single time you visit
            a new page. These cookies are typically removed or cleared when you
            log out to ensure that you can only access restricted features and
            areas when logged in.
          </p>
          <p>
            This site offers newsletter or email subscription services and

            understand our user base more accurately.
          </p>
          <p>
            These surveys may use cookies to remember who has already taken part
            in a survey or to provide you with accurate results after you change
            pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you submit data through a form such as those found on contact
            pages or comment forms, cookies may be set to remember your user

            that we feel may be of interest to you.<br />Several partners
            advertise on our behalf and affiliate tracking cookies allow us to
            see if our customers have come to the site through one of our

            <strong>SECURITY<br /></strong>The security of your personal
            information is important to us, and we strive to implement and
            maintain reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and
            practices appropriate to the nature of the information we store, in
            order to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use,
            modification, or disclosure.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the
            Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and we are
            unable to guarantee the absolute security of the personal
            information we have collected from you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>CREDIT CARD SECURITY<br /></strong>Your payment and personal
            information are always safe. Our Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software
            is the industry standard and among the best software available today
            for securing commercial transactions. It encrypts all of your
            personal information, including your credit card number, name, and
            address so that it cannot be read over the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not sell, rent or trade the personal information of the
            customer to any 3rd parties.

            maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province,
            country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data
            protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction.
