          </p>
          <p>
            The refund policy for a new purchase is covered by a 30-day
            money-back guarantee where we refund your money if you are
            dissatisfied with our work. In the case where a client is not

            which takes a maximum of 30 working days where we process in the
            client’s account either by credits or direct deposit through the
            bank account.
          </p>
          <p>
            All refunds will be issued to the original credit or debit card as
            provided. Refunds for all website and unsatisfied work issues will
            be made with the proper approval of the client. The customer needs
            to specify the details of the account and reason to the associates
            after which we will proceed as per requirements. The refund and
            cancellation will be generally issued in the following
            circumstances-
          </p>
          <p>
            • Non-Delivery Of The Product: Due to some mailing issues with your
            e-mail provider or your own mail server you might not receive the
            delivery e-mail from us. In this case, we recommend contacting us
            for assistance. Claims for non-delivery must be submitted to our
            Billing Department in writing within 30 days from the order placing
            date, otherwise, the product will be considered received and
            downloaded.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Download And Unzipping Issues: You may at times face problems
            downloading the product or its unzipping. Claims regarding such
            issues must be submitted to our Technical Support Department. If you
            do not properly contact us during this period, you agree that we may
            construe silence as a successful download of the product with no
            further right of redress or refund for a “download issue” reason.
            Failure to receive assistance for downloading or unzipping within 30
            days may result in a refund decline.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Major Defects: Although all the products are thoroughly tested
            before release, unexpected errors may occur. Such issues must be
            submitted for our Technical Support Team’s approval. We keep the
            right to rectify the error or defect within 72 hours. If any
            deficiency is approved and we fail to correct it within 72 hours
            from the date of the initial complaint letter or any other
            notification provided by a Customer, the refund will be issued to
            the customer in full without any compensations or reimbursements.
            OR, at the customer’s choice, replacement of the product of the same
            or around the same value can be offered. Please be advised that
            temporary access to your server can be requested by our technicians
            in order to identify and fix the possible issues with our Products.
            Failure to provide such access in a timely manner may result in a
            delayed resolution of the issue. Refusal to provide access to your
            sever will result in your inability to qualify for a refund.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Product Not-As-Described: Such issues should be reported to our
            Technical Support Department within 30 days from the date of the
            purchase. Clear evidence must be provided proving that the purchased
            product is not as it is described on the website. Complaints, which
            are based merely on the customer’s false expectations or wishes, are
            not honored.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Children Policy- Only persons age 18 or older have permission to
